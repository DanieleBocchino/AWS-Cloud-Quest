## Requirements
To complete this quest, you will need an AWS account with access to the following services:
- Amazon Lambda

## Steps
### Step 1: Create a Lambda Function
Create a new lambda function in the AWS Management Console. Give your function a name and select the programming language that you want to use. For this lab, we recommend using Python.

### Step 2: Write Your Lambda Function Code
Write the code for your lambda function. Keep it simple for this lab, such as a function that returns "Hello, World!" when called.

### Step 3: Test Your Lambda Function
Test your lambda function by invoking it from the AWS Management Console. Make sure that it returns the expected output.

### Step 4: Deploy Your Lambda Function
Deploy your lambda function by creating a new version and publishing it. This will make your function available for use by other AWS services.

### Step 5:  Write Your Lambda Function Code with Feeling
Write the code for your lambda function. Keep it simple for this lab, such as a function that returns "feeling : positive" when called.

### Step 6: Deploy Your Lambda Function and complite DIY
Deploy your lambda function by creating a new version and publishing it. This will make your function available for use by other AWS services.

## Conclusion
By completing this lab, you should have a better understanding of how to develop a lambda function using simple code. You should also be familiar with the basic concepts of serverless computing and AWS Lambda. With this foundation, you can begin exploring more advanced use cases for serverless computing in your AWS environment.
